# Jacob's Russian Roulette

Jacob requested that I make the program for his Russian Roulette game he wants to do with viewers on stream. So I made this small program in Python for it.


# Requirements
Python 3.13 is required.

# Usage

This program does not have a GUI, so you will have to run this either in terminal/Powershell, or your favorite Python IDE.

**1** - Plays one round of Russian Roulette with all the players currently added. Will not remember round count.<br/>
**2** - Plays automatically. This will play until 1 player is left. This does remember round count.<br/>
**3** - Adds a user(s) to the list of players.<br/>
**4** - Removes a user(s) from the list of players.<br/>
**5** - Displays all users in a list.<br/>

# Bug/Issue Reports
If there are any issues with the program, please contact me directly or open an issue on Github. I will fix it accordingly. (or if you want to fix it, you can! I will look over it first though.)
